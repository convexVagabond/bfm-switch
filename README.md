# bfm-switch
stripped down version of my modified brainfuck interpreter (bfm) for use with the Nintendo Switch.

the `,` command is not implemented *properly* yet.

## build directions:
- set up libnx
- use `make` to build

bam you now have an nro to use on the homebrew launcher

## use:
just make a file called `main.bf` with brainfuck code in it (comments are supported howeverand add it to the same directory as the nro
